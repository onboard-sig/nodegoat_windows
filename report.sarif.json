Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\n  2. When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\n\nFor example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-45] provide this capability.\n\n  3. For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.\n  4. Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.\n\nOS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.\n\nThis may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.\n\nBe careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.\n\n  5. Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.\n  6. Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\nWhen validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.\n\nDo not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.\n\n  7. Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.\n\nThis significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.\n\n  8. Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.\n\nMany file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.\n\n  9. Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-829](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)\n\n",

In addition to preventing reverse tabnabbing attacks, it may also improve browser performance as the new page can be run in a separate process.\n\nWhen the rel attribute is set to \"noopener\", the \"window.opener\" object is \"null\" on the new page. Therefore, the attacker cannot manipulate the navigation of the original page.  Additionally, the \"noreferrer\" attribute tells the browser to not include referrer information when the new page is requested.\n\nFor links opened with JavaScript, add the values \"noopener\", \"noreferrer\" as the \"windowFeatures\" parameter in the \"window.open()\" function:\n```\nvar childWindow = window.open(url, name, \"noopener,noreferrer\");   \n```\nFor legacy browser support, you can also manually set the opener to \"null\":\n```\nchildWindow.opener = null;  \n```\n\n**Note**: The rel=\"noopener\" attribute setting is supported by most modern browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari but is not supported by legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer. For the latest information on browser support, refer to https://caniuse.com/#search=rel.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1022](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1022.html)\n\n",

These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.\n\nFor example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.\n\n  3. Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.\n  4. In some cases, input validation may be an important strategy when output encoding is not a complete solution. For example, you may be providing the same output that will be processed by multiple consumers that use different encodings or representations. In other cases, you may be required to allow user-supplied input to contain control information, such as limited HTML tags that support formatting in a wiki or bulletin board. When this type of requirement must be met, use an extremely strict allowlist to limit which control sequences can be used. Verify that the resulting syntactic structure is what you expect. Use your normal encoding methods for the remainder of the input.\n  5. Use input validation as a defense-in-depth measure to reduce the likelihood of output encoding errors (see CWE-20).\n  6. Fully specify which encodings are required by components that will be communicating with each other.\n  7. When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html)\n\n",

Properly protect the key (CWE-320). If you cannot use encryption to protect the file, then make sure that the permissions are as restrictive as possible [REF-7].\n\nIn Windows environments, the Encrypted File System (EFS) may provide some protection.\n\n  2. For inbound authentication: Rather than hard-code a default username and password, key, or other authentication credentials for first time logins, utilize a \"first login\" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password or key.\n  3. If the software must contain hard-coded credentials or they cannot be removed, perform access control checks and limit which entities can access the feature that requires the hard-coded credentials. For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\n  4. For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash.\n\nUse randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.\n\n  5. For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.\n\n    * The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.\n    * Next, the passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.\n    * Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)\n\n",

For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.\n  4. For inbound authentication using passwords: apply strong one-way hashes to passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When handling an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the saved hash.\n\nUse randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that is generated. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.\n\n  5. For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.\n\n    * The first suggestion involves the use of generated passwords or keys that are changed automatically and must be entered at given time intervals by a system administrator. These passwords will be held in memory and only be valid for the time intervals.\n    * Next, the passwords or keys should be limited at the back end to only performing actions valid for the front end, as opposed to having full access.\n    * Finally, the messages sent should be tagged and checksummed with time sensitive values so as to prevent replay-style attacks.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)\n\n",

This can be accomplished either programmatically when setting Set-Cookie headers in responses or via deployment descriptors provided by various frameworks.\n\nThe setting \"SameSite=Strict\" provides the strongest protection against CSRF but the user experience works best when an application uses two different cookies, one for write-access that is locked down with \"SameSite=Strict\" and another for read-access that can have a more permissive setting, e.g., \"SameSite=Lax\". If the application only relies on one cookie for both read & write access, then the setting \"SameSite=Lax\" provides some protection against CSRF without too much negative impact on user experience. \n\nIt's worth noting that the definition of same-site is less restrictive than the definition of cross-origin, e.g., requests from other sub-domains are considered same-site although they are from a different origin. This means that even in browsers that fully support the \"SameSite\" cookie attribute, an attacker may still circumvent this protection if they can take over a subdomain or inject HTML or JavaScript into any subdomain of the same site. Therefore, relying on the \"SameSite\" attribute is not recommended as the sole defense against cross-site request forgery, it should instead be seen as a defense in depth mechanism that reduces the likelihood of CSRF.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1275](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1275.html)\n\n",

Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.\n  2. Compartmentalize the system to have \"safe\" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.\n\nEnsure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.\n\n## References\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)\n\n",
